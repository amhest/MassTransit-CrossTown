MassTransit-CrossTown
=====================

Originally this was envisioned as a port of Mass Transit to Java.  This has proven to be impractical and unnecessary for my needs.   Beginning with the develop branch this will be a minimal port to allow Java components to Send messages to MassTransit endpoints in the proper format and likewise publish events as needed.    It will ultimately support the ability to subscribe to events and receive messages as though it were an endpoint.
